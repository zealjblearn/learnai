# 📚 What is NumPy?

NumPy stands for:

```text
Numerical Python
```

It is the foundation library for:

* Scientific Computing
* Data Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Artificial Intelligence

Import NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
```

---

# Why NumPy?

Traditional Python lists are powerful but become slower when handling large datasets.

NumPy provides:

✅ Faster computation

✅ Less memory usage

✅ Mathematical operations

✅ Multi-dimensional arrays

✅ Foundation for Data Science

---

# Mathematical Operations Work on Arrays

One of NumPy's biggest strengths is performing operations on entire arrays.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

scores = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

print(scores + 5)
```

Output:

```text
[15 25 35 45]
```

Notice:

```text
5 is added to every element automatically.
```

---

# 1-D Array

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

scores = np.array([90, 80, 95, 70])

print(scores)
```

Output:

```text
[90 80 95 70]
```

Shape:

```python
print(scores.shape)
```

Output:

```text
(4,)
```

Meaning:

```text
4 elements in one dimension
```

---

# 2-D Array (Score Matrix)

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

scores = np.array([
    [90, 80, 95],
    [70, 85, 88]
])

print(scores)
```

Output:

```text
[[90 80 95]
 [70 85 88]]
```

Shape:

```python
print(scores.shape)
```

Output:

```text
(2, 3)
```

Meaning:

```text
2 rows
3 columns
```

---

# Multi-Dimensional Arrays

NumPy can store data in multiple dimensions.

Example:

```python
data = np.array([
    [
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4]
    ],
    [
        [5, 6],
        [7, 8]
    ]
])
```

Shape:

```python
print(data.shape)
```

Output:

```text
(2, 2, 2)
```

Meaning:

```text
2 blocks
2 rows
2 columns
```

---

# Important NumPy Methods

## Create Array

```python
np.array([1,2,3])
```

---

## Shape

```python
arr.shape
```

Returns:

```text
Rows and Columns
```

---

## Maximum Value

```python
arr.max()
```

---

## Minimum Value

```python
arr.min()
```

---

## Sum

```python
arr.sum()
```

---

## Mean

```python
arr.mean()
```

---

# Pandas Core Library is NumPy

Important Concept:

```text
Pandas is built on top of NumPy.
```

Architecture:

```text

Data Analysis
```

Because of this:

* Pandas is fast
* Pandas supports vectorized operations
* Pandas internally uses NumPy arrays

Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("players.csv")

print(df.values)
```

Output:

```text
NumPy Array
```

---

# Checking Installed Packages

List all installed packages:

```bash
pip list
```

Example Output:

```text
numpy
pandas
gradio
ollama
scikit-learn
```

---

# Installing Machine Learning Library

Install Scikit-Learn:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Verify Installation:

```bash
pip show scikit-learn
```

---

# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn patterns from data.

Instead of:

```text
Hardcoded Rules
```

the system learns from:

```text
Historical Data
```

---

# Simple Definition

```text
Machine Learning = Finding Patterns + Making Predictions
```

Example:

Historical Data:

```text
Study Hours → Marks
```

Machine Learning learns:

```text
More Study Hours → Higher Marks
```

Prediction:

```text
6 Hours Study → 85 Marks
```

# Machine Learning Algorithms

Algorithms are mathematical techniques used to find patterns.

Examples:

### Regression

Used for predicting numbers.

Examples:

* House Price Prediction
* Salary Prediction
* Sales Forecasting

---

### Classification

Used for predicting categories.

Examples:

* Spam or Not Spam
* Pass or Fail
* Disease Detection

---

### Clustering

Used for grouping similar data.

Examples:

* Customer Segmentation
* Product Recommendations

---

# Linear Regression

Most basic Machine Learning algorithm.

Import:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

Purpose:

Predict continuous values.

Example:

```text
Years of Experience → Salary
```

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
```

```

Algorithm automatically creates groups.

Examples:

* Customer Segmentation
* Marketing Analysis
